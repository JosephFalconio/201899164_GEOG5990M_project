Research Topic: Investiagting the relationship between Deprivation and Stop & Search by Police in Leeds.

This analysis investigates the relationship between socioeconomic deprivation and police stop and search activity in Leeds. Specifically, it explores whether individuals living in more deprived areas are disproportionately subject to stop and search by the police. By combining open data on police stop and search incidents with IMD data across different areas of Leeds, the project aims to uncover potential geographic and social disparities, contributing to policy changes and public discussion around fairness and plocing practices

Three exploratory data sets are used:
1) LSOA Boundaries downloaded from: https://geoportal.statistics.gov.uk/maps/761ecd09b4124843b95511a242e2b1a1

- This displays all the LSOAs for area of Leeds.

2) Stop and Search data for West Yorkshire for the month of march 2025, downloaded from: https://data.police.uk/data/fetch/ae117895-482f-455c-b437-599273b3da83/

- This data was too big to upload to github so it is linked to my google drive.

- This data shows all the stop and search occurances by West Yorkshire Police across all of West Yorkshire in March 2025.

3) Index of Multiple Deprivation (IMD) 

- This data contains IMD scores for all the LSOAs across England in 2019.

The Jupyter notebook included in this repository performs the following tasks:

- Loads and joins open data from multiple sources
- Cleans and preprocesses the datasets
- Performs exploratory data analysis using visualisations
- Conducts spatial analysis using geographic boundaries
- Presents two final visualizations:
  - One spatial visualisation (choropleth map)
  - One non-spatial visualization (scatter plot)
 
All data used and the ipynb file is additionally in the file uploaded to minerva.
